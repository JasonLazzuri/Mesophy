# Security Notes for Digital Signage Platform

## Debug and Test Endpoints

### üîí Secured Debug Endpoints
The following debug endpoints have been secured with proper authentication and authorization:

- `/api/debug/admin-client` - Admin client testing (dev-only, super_admin required)
- `/api/debug/env` - Environment configuration info (dev-only, super_admin required)  
- `/api/debug/users` - User data debugging (dev-only, super_admin required)

**Security measures applied:**
- ‚úÖ Disabled in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`)
- ‚úÖ Require authentication (`401` if not logged in)
- ‚úÖ Require super_admin role (`403` if insufficient permissions)
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposure (no service keys, tokens, or passwords)
- ‚úÖ Safe information only (configuration status, counts, basic info)

### ‚úÖ Test Endpoints (SECURED)
The following test endpoints have been secured with production-disabled access:

- `/api/test-admin` - Tests admin client creation (dev-only, super_admin required)
- `/api/test-auth` - Tests basic authentication (dev-only)
- `/api/test-new-auth` - Tests custom auth helper (dev-only)
- `/api/test-simple-auth` - Tests simplified auth (dev-only)
- `/api/test-rest` - Tests direct REST API calls (dev-only)

**Security measures applied:**
- ‚úÖ Disabled in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`)
- ‚úÖ Return 404 in production environment
- ‚úÖ Safe for development testing and debugging

## Security Improvements Made

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies ‚úÖ
- **File:** `supabase/secure_rls_policies.sql`
- **Status:** Fixed infinite recursion issue
- **Security:** Proper multi-tenant isolation restored
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions implemented

### 2. Authentication Standardization ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Users API used service keys instead of standard auth
- **Fix:** Updated `/api/users/route.ts` to use proper authentication
- **Result:** Consistent 401 responses across all endpoints

### 3. Debug Endpoint Security ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Exposed sensitive environment variables and user data
- **Fix:** Added authentication, authorization, and data sanitization
- **Protection:** Production-disabled, admin-only access

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Critical Security Tasks
- [ ] Deploy `secure_rls_policies.sql` to production database
- [ ] Remove or secure all `/api/test-*` endpoints
- [ ] Verify `NODE_ENV=production` in deployment environment
- [ ] Test that debug endpoints return 404 in production
- [ ] Replace placeholder Supabase credentials with real values
- [ ] Implement proper service key management (server-side only)

### Recommended Security Enhancements
- [ ] Enable middleware security with proper request validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security testing and penetration testing

## Environment Variables Security

### Secure Patterns ‚úÖ
- Server-side only service keys (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)
- Proper separation of client and server credentials
- No hardcoded secrets in source code

### Current Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Some service keys exposed as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` (should be server-side only)
- Placeholder credentials in development
