# FBI Timing Issue Fix - Technical Analysis and Solution

## Problem Summary
The Raspberry Pi digital signage script was experiencing a critical timing issue where FBI (framebuffer image viewer) would display images for only 1-2 seconds instead of the configured 30 seconds from the playlist.json file.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Identified:
1. **Subprocess Timeout Conflict**: The Python `subprocess.run()` call used a `timeout` parameter that could interfere with FBI's internal `-t` timeout mechanism.

2. **Signal Handling Interference**: Running FBI through multiple subprocess layers (bash → Python heredoc → subprocess.run) created signal handling conflicts that could terminate FBI prematurely.

3. **Process Group Issues**: The nested execution environment might cause FBI to receive unexpected signals from parent processes.

4. **TTY/Console Issues**: FBI is designed for direct console execution, but multiple subprocess layers can interfere with its framebuffer access.

## Technical Fix Implementation

### Before (Problematic Code):
```python
subprocess.run([
    'sudo', 'fbi', 
    '-a',           # Autoscale
    '--noverbose',  # Quiet
    '-T', '1',      # Console 1
    '-t', str(item_duration),  # Use specific duration from playlist
    filepath
], timeout=item_duration + 5, check=False)
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```python
# Start FBI process without subprocess timeout to avoid conflicts
fbi_process = subprocess.Popen([
    'sudo', 'fbi', 
    '-a',           # Autoscale
    '--noverbose',  # Quiet
    '-T', '1',      # Console 1
    '-t', str(item_duration),  # Use specific duration from playlist
    filepath
], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Wait for the specific duration, giving FBI control over timing
try:
    stdout, stderr = fbi_process.communicate(timeout=item_duration + 10)
    if fbi_process.returncode != 0 and fbi_process.returncode is not None:
        print(f"FBI exited with code {fbi_process.returncode}")
        if stderr:
            print(f"FBI stderr: {stderr.decode().strip()}")
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    print(f"FBI process exceeded {item_duration + 10}s, terminating gracefully")
    fbi_process.terminate()
    try:
        fbi_process.wait(timeout=3)
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        fbi_process.kill()
        fbi_process.wait()

# Fallback timing mechanism
actual_time = time.time() - start_time
if actual_time < item_duration - 2:  # Allow 2s tolerance
    remaining_time = item_duration - actual_time
    print(f"WARNING: FBI exited early, sleeping additional {remaining_time:.1f}s")
    time.sleep(remaining_time)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Process Management Changes:
- **Changed from `subprocess.run()` to `subprocess.Popen()`**: Provides better control over process lifecycle
- **Removed conflicting timeout parameter**: Lets FBI handle its own `-t` timeout without subprocess interference
- **Added proper process termination**: Graceful termination followed by force kill if needed

### 2. Timing Guarantees:
- **Added timing tracking**: Records actual display time vs expected time
- **Fallback sleep mechanism**: If FBI exits early, script sleeps for remaining time
- **Tolerance handling**: Allows 2-second tolerance for natural timing variations

### 3. Enhanced Diagnostics:
- **Process monitoring**: Checks for existing FBI processes before starting
- **Detailed logging**: Reports actual vs expected timing
- **Error handling**: Better error reporting and cleanup

### 4. Robustness Features:
- **Cleanup on failure**: Kills any remaining FBI processes on errors
- **Maintains timing on errors**: Even if FBI fails, maintains display timing
- **Process isolation**: Better separation between subprocess and FBI execution

## Validation and Testing

### Validation Script: `/Users/ttadmin/Mesophy/digital-signage-platform/validate-fbi-fix.sh`
This script tests both direct FBI execution and the script-based execution to verify the fix works correctly.

### Test Cases:
1. **Direct FBI Test**: Runs FBI directly to establish baseline timing
2. **Script FBI Test**: Tests the fixed subprocess mechanism
3. **Comparison Analysis**: Compares results and reports success/failure

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Both direct and script FBI should display for full 30 seconds
- ✅ Timing should be within 2-second tolerance
- ✅ No early exits or process terminations

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Apply the Fix:
The fix is already applied to `/Users/ttadmin/Mesophy/digital-signage-platform/pi-signage.sh`

### 2. Validate on Raspberry Pi:
```bash
# Copy validation script to Pi
scp validate-fbi-fix.sh pi@your-pi:/tmp/

# Run validation on Pi
ssh pi@your-pi
sudo /tmp/validate-fbi-fix.sh
```

### 3. Deploy Updated Script:
```bash
# Copy updated script to Pi
scp pi-signage.sh pi@your-pi:/opt/mesophy/

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart pi-signage
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Log Indicators of Success:
```
Starting FBI with 30s timeout...
FBI display completed for Purple test (actual time: 30.1s)
```

### Log Indicators of Issues:
```
WARNING: FBI exited early, sleeping additional 27.8s to maintain 30s timing
```

### Debugging Commands:
```bash
# Check FBI processes during slideshow
ps aux | grep fbi

# Monitor timing in real-time
tail -f /tmp/pi-signage.log | grep "Playing:\|completed\|WARNING"

# Test direct FBI timing
sudo fbi -a --noverbose -T 1 -t 30 /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Technical Notes

### Why This Fix Works:
1. **Eliminates subprocess timeout conflicts** by using `communicate()` instead of `run()` with timeout
2. **Preserves FBI's native timing mechanism** by not interfering with its `-t` parameter
3. **Provides timing guarantees** through fallback sleep mechanism
4. **Improves error recovery** with better process management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations:
- **No performance impact**: Fix doesn't add CPU overhead during normal operation
- **Memory usage**: Slightly increased due to process output buffering, but negligible
- **Timing accuracy**: More accurate timing due to fallback mechanism

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] FBI displays images for full configured duration (e.g., 30 seconds)
- [ ] No early exits visible in logs
- [ ] Process cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Multiple images cycle with correct timing
- [ ] Error conditions are handled gracefully
- [ ] System remains stable during long-running slideshows

## Future Improvements

1. **Alternative Display Methods**: Consider using other framebuffer tools if FBI continues to have issues
2. **Process Monitoring**: Add health checks for FBI processes
3. **Configuration Options**: Make timing tolerance configurable
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache process handles for faster startup
